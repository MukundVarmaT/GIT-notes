# Useful commands

### Generate `.gitignore`

Too lazy to copy and paste or download your `.gitignore` file each time you create a new repository?

```
curl -s https://www.gitignore.io/api/{your_list} >> .gitignore
```

Replace **`{your_list}`** with a comma-separated-list _(one or more)_ of **Operating System** or **IDE** or **Programming Language**, here are some examples:

- `https://www.gitignore.io/api/windows`
- `https://www.gitignore.io/api/visualstudio`
- `https://www.gitignore.io/api/c++`
- `https://www.gitignore.io/api/linux,intellij,java`

### Export Repository's Archive

GitHub has `Download as .zip` option in all hosted repositories and to do the same from your terminal

```
git archive master --output=master.zip
```

### Clean Local Untracked Files

Before cleaning its always good to know which files are going to be cleaned

```
git clean -n
```

Then when you are comfortable use the `-f` or `-fd` option.

```
git clean -f     # Cleans files only without cleaning directories
git clean -fd    # Cleans files & directories
```

### Delete All Branches Except `master`

Having a lot of branches also leads to a very messy repo. 

```
git branch | grep -v 'master' | xargs git branch -D
```

You can replace `master` with any other branch name that you want to keep, but be careful **this will delete master**.  
Or even use a pattern of **more than one branch** to keep them and delete the rest.

```
git branch | grep -v 'master\|gh-pages' | xargs git branch -D
```

### Delete Remote-tracking Branches

Deleting local branches doesn't clean the repo 100%, since they were tracking remote branches (This will only work if you've already deleted the remote branch from your GitHub repo)_

```
git fetch --prune
```

### Delete an Entire Commit

Deleting a commit is **dangerous**, since the SHA of all following commits **will change**. Please be careful using this!

```
git rebase --onto <commit-SHA>^ <commit-SHA>
```

### Create Orphan Branch

Orphan branches aren't based on any other branches.The first commit made on this new orphan branch will have no parents and it will be the **root of a new history** totally disconnected from all the other branches and commits.  
This can be useful when lets say you are using GitHub Pages you want to completely it separate from your repositoryâ€™s prior history.

```

                                                      |
              i---j---k     <== branch 'feature-1'    |
             /                                        |    a---b---c---d       <== branch 'master'
    a---b---c---d---h---l   <== branch 'master'       |
         \         /                                  |        1---2---3---4   <== branch 'gh-pages' (orphan)
          e---f---g         <== branch 'feature-2'    |
                                                      |
                   [Normal Branches]                  |                    [Orphan Branch]

```

To create a new empty orphan branch, use the following commands

```
git checkout --orphan <new-branch-name>
rm .git/index
git clean -fdx
```

### Remove large unwanted files from repository

Check out [link](https://rtyley.github.io/bfg-repo-cleaner/). For better explanation read [Usage](https://rtyley.github.io/bfg-repo-cleaner/#usage) from the official site.

An example usage:

- Download [Java Runtime Environment](https://www.java.com/en/download/manual.jsp) (Java 8 or above).
- Download [BFG][bfg] from official site.
- Determine the files you want to remove: Use specific names (`junk.txt`) or wildcards (`*.mp4`).
- Clone a fresh copy of **`{your_big_repo}`**, using the --mirror flag:<br/><br/>
    ```
    git clone --mirror https://github.com/{your_big_repo}.git
    ```
- Run BFG to clean your repository up:<br/><br/>
    ```
    java -jar bfg-1.13.0.jar --delete-files "{Passwords.txt,*.mp4}" {your_big_repo}.git
    ```
- Strip out the unwanted dirty data then push:<br/><br/>
    ```
    cd {your_big_repo}.git
    git reflog expire --expire=now --all && git gc --prune=now --aggressive
    git push
    ```
### List Ignored Files

To check if .gitignore is ignoring the files you actually want then

```bash
git ls-files --others --ignored --exclude-standard
```

### Find File sizes

To keep track of your repository size.

```
git rev-list --objects --all \
| git cat-file --batch-check='%(objecttype) %(objectname) %(objectsize) %(rest)' \
| sed -n 's/^blob //p' \
| sort --numeric-sort --key=2 \
| cut -c 1-12,41- \
| $(command -v gnumfmt || echo numfmt) --field=2 --to=iec-i --suffix=B --padding=7 --round=nearest
```























### Some other commands

- `git clean -n` - clean local untracked files
- `git clean -f` - clean files only without cleaning directories
- `git clean -fd` - clean files along with directories
- `git branch | grep -v 'master' | xargs git branch -D` - delete all branches except master
- `git branch | grep -v 'master\|gh-pages' | xargs git branch -D` - delete all branches except master and gh-pages (can be extended to any number of branches)
- `git fetch --prune` - delete remote-tracking branches
- `git rebase <base>` - this automatically rebases the current branch onto <base>
- `git rebase --interactive <base>` - running git rebase with the -i flag begins an interactive rebasing session. Instead of blindly moving all of the commits to the new base, interactive rebasing gives you the opportunity to alter individual commits in the process.
- `curl -s https://www.gitignore.io/api/{your_list} >> .gitignore` - to easily download .gitignore files instead of copying them each time. Replace `{your-list}` with appropriate Operating System or IDE or Programming Language names for example : `https://www.gitignore.io/api/windows or https://www.gitignore.io/api/visualstudio or https://www.gitignore.io/api/c++ or https://www.gitignore.io/api/linux,intellij,java`. Mulitple names can also be given by seperating with a comma. 
- `git checkout --orphan <new-branch-name>` - To create a new orphan branch. Orphan branches aren't based on any other branches.The first commit made on this new orphan branch will have no parents and it will be the root of a new history totally disconnected from all the other branches and commits.
